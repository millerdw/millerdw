### A bit about me
I'm a data scientist / machine learning engineer working ~~in the City of London~~ from home. I started by learning SQL, then C# and .NET, and soon became a database developer and poor man's DBA. Eventually I began playing with functional languages as well, and after a few years I joined a quantitative investment team. In 2019 I decided to take a year out to complete a masters degree in Machine Learning with UCL, and now mostly code in Python, making use of libraries like Pytorch, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.

### And my motivations

Originally this blog was designed to let me stretch my legs in languages and tools that I don't get to use at work, but soon I began to enjoy the process, and the feeling that I was 'giving something back' to all of the dev communities that had been so valuable to me as a student.

### Contact me

If you have a comment about this blog please [raise an issue](https://github.com/millerdw/millerdw.github.io/issues/new/choose) in this repository. I hope that this will never be a closed book, and even if I move away from it for a little while, it will always be something I can come back to and continue contributing.

Thanks for reading

Dave
