# About this blog

### A bit about me
I'm a data scientist/developer working in the City of London. I started by learning SQL, then C# and .NET, and soon became a database developer and poor man's DBA. Eventually I began playing with functional languages as well, and after a few years I joined a quantitative investment team.

### And my motivations

Originally this blog was designed to let me stretch my legs in languages and tools that I don't get to use at work, but soon I began to enjoy the process, and the feeling that I was 'giving something back' to all of the dev communities that had been so valuable to me as a student.

### Contact me

If you have a comment about this blog please raise an issue for this repository. I hope that this will never be a closed book, and even if I move away from it for a little while, it will always be something I can come back to and continue contributing.

Thanks for reading

Dave
