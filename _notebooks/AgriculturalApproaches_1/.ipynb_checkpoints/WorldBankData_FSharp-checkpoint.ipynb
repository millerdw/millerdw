The upshot of this (and the amount of Stargate, Voyager, and TNG I was watching at the time) means that I now have a penchant for hydroponics, a slightly unhealthy fascination with fertilizer, and a lasting interest in all things agricultural. \n",

But depletion and degradation of land and water pose serious challenges to producing enough food and other agricultural products to sustain livelihoods here and meet the needs of urban populations. Data presented here include measures of agricultural inputs, outputs, and productivity compiled by the UN&#39;s Food and Agriculture Organization.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Aid Effectiveness</td><td>Aid effectiveness is the impact that aid has in reducing poverty and inequality, increasing growth, building capacity, and accelerating achievement of the Millennium Development Goals set by the international community. Indicators here cover aid received as well as progress in reducing poverty and improving education, health, and other measures of human welfare.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Economy &amp; Growth</td><td>Economic growth is central to economic development. When national income grows, real people benefit. While there is no known formula for stimulating economic growth, data can help policy-makers better understand their countries&#39; economic situations and guide any work toward improvement. Data here covers measures of economic growth, such as gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national income (GNI). It also includes indicators representing factors known to be relevant to economic growth, such as capital stock, employment, investment, savings, consumption, government spending, imports, and exports.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Education</td><td>Education is one of the most powerful instruments for reducing poverty and inequality and lays a foundation for sustained economic growth. The World Bank compiles data on education inputs, participation, efficiency, and outcomes. Data on education are compiled by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics from official responses to surveys and from reports provided by education authorities in each country.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Energy &amp; Mining</td><td>The world economy needs ever-increasing amounts of energy to sustain economic growth, raise living standards, and reduce poverty. But today&#39;s trends in energy use are not sustainable. As the world&#39;s population grows and economies become more industrialized, nonrenewable energy sources will become scarcer and more costly. Data here on energy production, use, dependency, and efficiency are compiled by the World Bank from the International Energy Agency and the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Environment</td><td>Natural and man-made environmental resources – fresh water, clean air, forests, grasslands, marine resources, and agro-ecosystems – provide sustenance and a foundation for social and economic development.  The need to safeguard these resources crosses all borders.  Today, the World Bank is one of the key promoters and financiers of environmental upgrading in the developing world. Data here cover forests, biodiversity, emissions, and pollution. Other indicators relevant to the environment are found under data pages for Agriculture &amp; Rural Development, Energy &amp; Mining, Infrastructure, and Urban Development.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Financial Sector</td><td>An economy&#39;s financial markets are critical to its overall development. Banking systems and stock markets enhance growth, the main factor in poverty reduction. Strong financial systems provide reliable and accessible information that lowers transaction costs, which in turn bolsters resource allocation and economic growth. Indicators here include the size and liquidity of stock markets; the accessibility, stability, and efficiency of financial systems; and international migration and workers\\ remittances, which affect growth and social welfare in both sending and receiving countries.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Health</td><td>Improving health is central to the Millennium Development Goals, and the public sector is the main provider of health care in developing countries. To reduce inequities, many countries have emphasized primary health care, including immunization, sanitation, access to safe drinking water, and safe motherhood initiatives.  Data here cover health systems, disease prevention, reproductive health, nutrition, and population dynamics. Data are from the United Nations Population Division, World Health Organization, United Nations Children&#39;s Fund, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, and various other sources.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Infrastructure</td><td>Infrastructure helps determine the success of manufacturing and agricultural activities. Investments in water, sanitation, energy, housing, and transport also improve lives and help reduce poverty. And new information and communication technologies promote growth, improve delivery of health and other services, expand the reach of education, and support social and cultural advances. Data here are compiled from such sources as the International Road Federation, Containerisation International, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Energy Association, and the International Telecommunications Union.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Social Protection &amp; Labor</td><td>The supply of labor available in an economy includes people who are employed, those who are unemployed but seeking work, and first-time job-seekers. Not everyone who works is included: unpaid workers, family workers, and students are often omitted, while some countries do not count members of the armed forces. Data on labor and employment are compiled by the International Labour Organization (ILO) from labor force surveys, censuses, establishment censuses and surveys, and administrative records such as employment exchange registers and unemployment insurance schemes.</td></tr><tbody></tbody></table>"

The free access to all of this source code on github is an amazing, beautiful, thing, and it shouldn't be taken for granted. The same goes for tools like NuGet and Paket; I've been able to take a random file of text from a globally distributed storage architecture, plug it into a system on my own PC, download data from somewhere else in the world and print it out for you here... if you believe Arthur C Clarke, **this is *literally* magic**.
